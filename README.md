sieve of eratosthenes
---------------------

A python function for finding prime numbers using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm.  This version does not include even numbers in the list of possible primes, cutting memory usage by a factor of 2.

This function can successfully find all primes less than 100,000,000.
